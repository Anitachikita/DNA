# CS50 Project: DNA

This project is a part of the Harvard CS50 Course (2023) and involves analyzing DNA sequences. The goal of this project is to implement a program that takes a DNA sequence as input and performs various analyses on it.

## Programming Language: Python

The project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

## How It Works

There are two main datasets compared within this program: the CSV database files and the DNA sequences. 

The CSV file contains data about individuals, including their names and the number of sequential nucleotides that occur within their DNA. 

The DNA sequence file consists of a single "raw" string consisting of nucleotides represented by the letters A, C, G, and T.

The `dna.py` script compares the DNA sequences against the databases.

By comparing the counts of different STRs, the program can match the DNA sequence against the individuals in the database, ultimately determining the likely owner of the DNA.
